## Bachelorarbeit(main.pdf)
Bachelorarbeit zum Thema AKS-Primzahltest

## thesis 
1. the thesis contains a theoretical overview of the AKS-Algorithm and a proof of correctness(all in german)
2. The thesis also contains the runtime analysis of each step of the AKS-algorithm(including plots). You can access the plots by simply going to the directory named plots. 


## prerequisites
1. Python
2. matplotlib: [Download here](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html)
3. Scipy: [Download here](https://www.scipy.org/)
2. SageMath: [Download at the official SageMath website](https://www.sagemath.org/)

## how to run the code and the run time analysis 
### how to run the code
go to the directory named code and run the aks.sage file to run the script use `sage aks.sage`
### to see and run the run time analysis
uncomment the lines where it says "uncomment to see the run time analysis"
to display the plots presented in the thesis, go to code and run the file `rt_tests.py`(uncomment the method you want analyse)
