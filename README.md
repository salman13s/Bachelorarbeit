# Bachelorarbeit
Bachelorarbeit zum Thema AKS-Primzahltest

# thesis 
1. the thesis contains a theoretical overview of the AKS-Algorithm 
2. it also contains the runtime analysis of each step of the AKS-algorithm(including plots)


# prerequisites
1. Python
2. SageMath: [download at the official SageMath website](https://www.sagemath.org/)

# how to run the code and the run time analysis 
## how to run the code
go to the directory code and run the aks.sage file to run the algorithm using Inline `sage aks.sage`
## to see and run the run time analysis
uncomment the lines where it says "uncomment to see the run time analysis"
to see the plots presented in the thesis, go to code and run the file Inline `newton.py`(uncomment the method you want analyse)
