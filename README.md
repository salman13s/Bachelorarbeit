## Bachelorarbeit(main.pdf)
Bachelorarbeit zum Thema AKS-Primzahltest

## thesis 
1. the thesis contains a theoretical overview of the AKS-Algorithm and the proof of correctness(all in german)
2. it also contains the runtime analysis of each step of the AKS-algorithm(including plots)


## prerequisites
1. Python
2. matplotlib: [Download here](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/index.html)
3. Scipy: [Download here](https://www.scipy.org/)
2. SageMath: [Download at the official SageMath website](https://www.sagemath.org/)

# how to run the code and the run time analysis 
## how to run the code
go to the directory code and run the aks.sage file to run the algorithm use `sage aks.sage`
## to see and run the run time analysis
uncomment the lines where it says "uncomment to see the run time analysis"
to see the plots presented in the thesis, go to code and run the file `newton.py`(uncomment the method you want analyse)   
# acknowledgements
Thanks to [Vijay Menon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3785) for his code and explanations, which i used to implement the 5th step of the algorithm
